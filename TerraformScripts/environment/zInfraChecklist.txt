Requirements
-Source VM network
-Destination VM network
-Source Virtual Machines
-Source Storage account
-Cache Storage Account


Components of Site Recovery Services
-Object in the vault that represents the azure region where vms are protected
-Only one fabric object can be created per region.
-If enabled replication from portal, it gets created automatically
-You cant create new one if already exist

Protection Container
-Container used to group replicated items within a Fabric (Primary Conatiner & Recovery Container)


Proctection Container Mapping
-Maps the Primary Proctection Conatiner with a recovery Protection Container
-For reverse replication the roles of the original region and the recovery region
 switch. The original region now becomes a new recovery region and viceversa

Cache Storage account
-Holds replication changes temporarily
-Azure creates one storage cache if not create by You

Network Mapping
-This maps primary region vnet to disaster recovery vnet in secondary region

       name = testvnet
       location = West Us 3
-Azure Virtual network primary √
-Azure subnets Virtual network primary √
-Azure Virtual Machines Primary √
-Azure Network Interface card √
-Primary ublic Ip √
-Network security group √
-Azure recovery service vault 
-Azure site recovery fabric primary 
-Azure Site recovery protection Container primary
-Replication policy
-Azure site recovery protection Conatiner Mapping
-Azure site recovery network mapping
-Storage account primary
-Azure replication task to automate replication
-Azure Automation Account to run runbooks
        This runbook prompts the user to enter the source and target resource group names, 
        source and target virtual machine names, and performs the following steps:

        -Connects to Azure
        -Gets the source and target virtual machines
        -Checks if the source and target virtual machines exist
        -Gets the source and target virtual networks
        -Replicates the virtual machine
        -Checks the replication status
         Note: This is just an example and you may need to modify it to match your specific requirements.
